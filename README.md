# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

Design and implement a frontend to display an asset list
Assets are types of trades that are available to trade on using the Deriv platform. Deriv offers
public API’s that can be accessed to query and initiate trades. Using these, please design and
implement a small web-based solution that satisfies the requirements below taking into account
any specific considerations you think is appropriate when developing high-performing and
usable web pages.

## Asset list high-level requirements

- :white_check_mark: As a user, I can filter the asset list by category (e.g Forex, Stock indices etc) and
  sub-category (e.g. Major pairs), so that I can find assets that match what I’m looking for.
- :white_check_mark: As a user, I can see real
  time prices for each asset, so that I can decide which one I
  want to trade on.
- :white_check_mark: As a user, I can see the highest and lowest price in the last 24 hour period, so that I can
  see the fluctuations over the day.
- :white_check_mark: As a user, I can see the highest and lowest price in a mini chart, so that I can visualize
  the price changes.
